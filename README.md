# Zebra Enterprise Browser - OCR Wedge
Sample project that demonstrates how a web app can leverage Zebra Devices' OCR features offered by DataWedge.
This integration is made possible by [Zebra Enterprise Browser](https://techdocs.zebra.com/enterprise-browser/), an industrial browser that can interact with device OS and HW as a native app.

OCR Wedge uses machine learning to enable fine-tuned, use-case-specific models to extract data in real-time via the Zebra Android device camera and completely offline. Supported configurations:
- License Plates
- Identification Documents
- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
- Tire Identification Number (TIN)
- Shipping Container ID
- Meter Reading

  - */enterprise/device/enterprisebrowser/*
- Close and launch again the Enterprise Browser
- Enjoy ðŸ¦“

## Background
OCR functionalities rely on DataWedge which can be controlled programmatically via Intents.
Leveraging on Enterprise Browser you can send and receive intents from a web app.

### Enterprise Browser integration w/ DataWedge
This project includes a pre-configured DataWedge config file that has one profile per each OCR feature.
The web app switches profiles when needed by triggering an intent and get captured data through a broadcast receiver.
Each profile sends acquired data to the web app using intents with different action names in order to identify the data types.
You can find Enterprise Browser basic setup info [here](https://techdocs.zebra.com/enterprise-browser/3-3/guide/datawedge/).

### If you wanna know more...

- Register DataWedge Intents in Enterprise Browser (one intent per each profile so that we can distinguish this):
